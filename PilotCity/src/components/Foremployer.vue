            Dear Employers,
        </div>

        <div class="letter-body">
           It was excellent to have you hear about us through a source I can't think of right now. Our program is addressing the incredible challenges our employers are facing in the midst of a transformative economy towards the digital age. With the unemployment rate at a low and the growing pains of digitally transformation, we are creating a workforce solution that goes deeper into the rabbit hole than most do not care to enter. That black box is the inevitable rehabilitation and reinvigoration of high school classrooms and their connectedness to the real world. If you must, we invite you to go down the rabbit hole deeper.
